## Aerial Intel - data challenge
The objective is to create an accurate model to predict wheat yield in some counties in the US. The counties are located in the states of Washington, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas and Montana. Two years of data are available. Each datasets contains over 170,000 observations of 23 variables (the variables dates, county name and state are not taken into account). Most of the variable are climatic (temperature, precipitations, pressure etc). 
We will encourage simpler models that give slightly less accurate predictions but are easier to interpret. 

## Exploratory data analysis

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(corrplot)
c2013 <- cor(df2013)
corrplot(c2013,method="pie",type="lower")
```

## Multiple linear regression with lasso

## Timelime

```{r cars}

```
